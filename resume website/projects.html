	<h2>Top Down Shooter</h2>
	<hr>
	<p class="projectsText">This is a game I created for my AP Computer Science class. It was made on unity using scripts and C#, which I decided on based off of the ease of use that came with using unity to attach scripts to objects. The game is really basic, involving a fully controllable character that can shoot a weapon at endlessly spawning zombies on a wide platform that come from all directions. There is a score system at the top that tracks how many zombies the player has killed over the course of the run. The player can take a certain amount of hits before game over, as well as invincibility frames between each hit to avoid instantly dying by beinmg surrounded.</p>

	<h2>Checkers Bot</h2>
	<hr>
	<p class="projectsText">This is a Checkers bot that I created for my CS-100 class. It was made to compete in a tournament where students would submit their own bot and the bots would compete against each otehr to see which bot would be the best checkers bot. My bot looks at the board state after every move and by using preset board states and patterns that I programmed in, the bot decides on the best possible move to go with. It will constantly try to maintain an advantageous position on the board while taking the best possible pieces from the opponent.</p>

	<h2>CTA Station</h2>
	<hr>
	<p class="projectsText">This was a project I made for my CS-201 class in Java. It is a CTA station program that is able to add edit and modify CTA stations and their routes, find the nearest station given the users location, generate a path between two stations when given the names by the user, and in the case of multiple stations with similar names, ask to clarify. The project takes in files of CTA Stations and their longitude and latitude locations to do all this, and in the case of not having a file or if the station isn't on the file, the user can create the station and add it to the file.</p>

	<h2>Social Norms and the Looking Glass Self</h2>
	<hr>
	<p class="projectsText">This was an essay I wrote for my Sociology-201 class that talks about how we, as humans, look to others in order to come up with an idea of who we are as people and what is defined as "normal". I expand on and talk about a topic that we covered in class in more depth giving my input and thoughts on the topic.</p>

	<h2>Diagnosis of a Fictional Character</h2>
	<hr>
	<p class="projectsText">This was an essay I wrote for my Psychopathology class, where we were required to pick a fictional character and diagnose them with a disorder, giving justification as to why we think they have those disorders. I go in depth on why my chosen character, Nico Di Angelo, has Social Anxiety, Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, and Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder. I go over possible treamtment plans and what the character could do to improve their situation. </p>
